# React todos code challenge
**react-todos-code-challenge** is a code challenge for React developers applying for a job at IT Tick.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Scenario
So here you are! You decided to apply for a job at IT Tick and now we are asking you to help us with a Todo App.
We already setup a brand new project for you that already contains a very basic create-react-app setup. Your task is now to finish the Todo App by completing the features to add, edit and delete todos and storing them only in the client storage.

## Technical starting point
Our team was already able to complete the following:

* Add the basic app and component structure
* Add `prop-types` for prop validation
* Add `node-sass`

## Mission
- [ ] Fork this repository
- [ ] Create a named `redux` module to hold your todos
- [ ] Complete the CRUD features in the GUI and make sure they are reflected in the store
- [ ] Make sure the `todo-list` component dynamically displays the todos
- [ ] Add functionality to edit existing todos
- [ ] Submit a merge request and describe your changes precisely

## Bonus
- [ ] Add [Redux-ORM](https://github.com/redux-orm/redux-orm)
- [ ] Document with [jsDoc](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/) comments

## Please note
- Write concise commit messages
- Pay attention for responsive design.
- Use either CSS Modules or [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).
- Use semantic elements when possible.
- Pay attention to your code style and structure, don't ignore the eslint hints.
- Design your React components: use props, slots and whatever you need to keep your code clean.
- Display well in Google Chrome.
- Don't test browsers except latest Google Chrome.

## Feel free to
- Clean styles / Improve design to have better UI and UX.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Create new modules/methods/components..
- Modify existing code.
- Add new packages.
- Add tests
- Edit `README.md` to add documentation.
